# Augment Agent - Neovim Plugin

## Project Overview

- **Language**: Rust
- **Type**: Neovim plugin (cdylib)
- **Purpose**: AI-powered code editing assistant that integrates with Neovim to apply code changes from chat conversations
- **Framework**: Uses `nvim-oxi` for Neovim integration and `mlua` for Lua interop

## Key Dependencies

- `nvim-oxi` (0.6.0) - Neovim API bindings for Rust
- `mlua` (0.10.5) - Lua integration with async support
- `serde` (1.0.219) - Serialization/deserialization
- `thiserror` (2.0.12) - Error handling
- `shell-escape` (0.1.5) - Shell command escaping
- `once_cell` (1.21.3) - Lazy static initialization

## Project Structure

### Core Files

- `src/lib.rs` - Main plugin entry point, defines Neovim commands
- `src/buffer.rs` - Buffer management and attachment logic
- `src/chat.rs` - Chat functionality and code application
- `src/code_extractor.rs` - Markdown code block parsing
- `src/commands.rs` - Neovim command implementations
- `src/error.rs` - Error types and handling
- `src/state.rs` - Global plugin state management

### Build Configuration

- `Cargo.toml` - Rust project configuration with cdylib crate type
- `Cargo.lock` - Dependency lock file
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules (excludes `/target`)

## Key Functionality

### Neovim Commands

The plugin registers three main commands:

1. `MyAugmentApply` - Apply code changes from chat buffer
2. `MyAugmentChat` - Send message to AI chat (with optional arguments)
3. `MyAugmentChatClear` - Clear chat history and start new session

### Code Block Processing

- Parses markdown code blocks with metadata: `lang path=file.rs mode=EDIT`
- Only applies blocks with `mode=EDIT` and a valid `path`
- Uses simple fence matching: finds first closing fence that matches opening fence length
- Tracks line numbers for each code block (excluding fence lines themselves)
- Handles extended fence lengths (4+ backticks) but ignores complex nesting scenarios

### Buffer Management

- Automatically attaches to buffers named ending with "AugmentChatHistory"
- Monitors buffer changes in real-time using `on_lines` callbacks
- Maintains state across chat sessions
- Handles buffer validation and error recovery

## Development Guidelines

### Error Handling

- Use custom `Result<T>` type defined in `error.rs`
- Handle `PoisonError` from mutex locks appropriately
- Provide meaningful error messages for user-facing operations
- Use `?` operator for error propagation in internal functions

### State Management

- Global state is managed through `STATE` mutex in `state.rs`
- Use `FIRST_ROUND_ATTACHED` atomic boolean for attachment tracking
- Always validate buffer state before operations
- Clear state appropriately on detach/clear operations

### Code Style

- Use descriptive variable names and function signatures
- Include comprehensive unit tests for core functionality
- Document public functions and complex logic
- Handle edge cases (empty blocks, unclosed fences, etc.)

### Buffer Operations

- Always check buffer validity before operations
- Use absolute paths for buffer matching when possible
- Handle both relative and absolute path lookups
- Provide clear error messages for buffer-related failures

### Shell Integration

- Use proper shell escaping for command arguments
- Handle special characters (!, %, quotes) in chat messages
- Escape commands before passing to Neovim's command interface

## Testing

- Unit tests are included for critical functions
- Test edge cases like empty inputs, malformed code blocks
- Verify shell escaping behavior with special characters
- Test code block extraction with various fence types and nested scenarios
- Code fence tests follow simple matching principle (first matching closing fence wins)

## Plugin Integration

### Initial Setup

- First chat message automatically includes initial instruction
- Instruction: "Always output full files, never just partial code. Never omit code, even if it is unchanged"
- Buffer attachment happens automatically on first use

### Chat Workflow

1. User sends chat message via `MyAugmentChat`
2. Plugin attaches to chat buffer if not already attached
3. AI responds with code blocks in chat buffer
4. User applies changes via `MyAugmentApply`
5. Plugin parses EDIT blocks and updates corresponding files
6. Chat history is cleared after successful application

## Best Practices

### When Adding New Features

- Follow the existing error handling patterns
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Update state management if needed
- Consider buffer lifecycle and cleanup
- Document new command functionality

### When Modifying Core Logic

- Test with various buffer states (attached/detached/invalid)
- Verify error propagation works correctly
- Check mutex lock handling for deadlock prevention
- Ensure atomic operations are used appropriately for flags
- When updating code extraction logic, maintain simple fence matching behavior
- Test expectations should match the simple "first matching fence" principle

### When Working with Neovim API

- Always check return values from API calls
- Use appropriate notification levels (Info/Error)
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Test command registration and argument parsing

## Code Extraction Algorithm

### Fence Matching Logic

The code block extraction follows a simple, predictable algorithm:

1. **Opening Fence Detection**: Finds lines starting with 3+ backticks at beginning of line
2. **Metadata Parsing**: Extracts language and attributes (path, mode) from opening fence line
3. **Content Collection**: Collects all lines until first matching closing fence
4. **Closing Fence Matching**: Finds first fence with same backtick count as opener, at line start
5. **Simple Approach**: No complex nesting logic - first matching closing fence wins

### Key Principles

- **Line-start matching only**: Fences must start at the beginning of the line
- **No indented fences**: Ignores fences that are indented or embedded in text
- **First match wins**: Stops at first closing fence that matches opening fence length
- **Literal content**: Treats everything between fences as literal content, including nested fences

### Test Behavior Example

```rust
// Input text:
"```\n```rust\nlet x = 5;\n```\n```"

// Result: One code block with content:
"```rust\nlet x = 5;"
// (stops at first matching ``` fence)
```

## Common Patterns

### Buffer Finding

```rust
// Find buffer by name pattern
for buf in api::list_bufs() {
    if buf.get_name()?.ends_with("AugmentChatHistory") {
        // Handle buffer
    }
}
```

### State Access

```rust
// Lock state and handle poison errors
let mut state = STATE.lock()?;
// Perform operations
```

### Code Block Processing

```rust
// Extract and process code blocks
let parsed_content = extract_code_blocks(&content);
for block in parsed_content {
    if block.mode.as_deref() == Some("EDIT") {
        // Apply changes
    }
}
```
